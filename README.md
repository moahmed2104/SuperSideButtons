# SuperSideButtons

macOS mostly ignores the M4/M5 mouse buttons. Some apps map them to navigation and various mouse brands have apps to map them to different commands and macros, but they're often buggy and clunky. SuperSideButtons allows you to map your mouse's side buttons to several macOS functions like in-app navigation, switching between spaces, and changing volume. It also gives you the ability to define keyboard macros so you can map your side buttons to keyboard shortcuts.

## About SuperSideButtons

SuperSideButtons is a fork of [SaneSideButtons](https://github.com/thealpa/SaneSideButtons) which is a fork of the abandoned [SensibleSideButtons](https://github.com/archagon/sensible-side-buttons) by Alexei Baboulevitch. More information about SensibleSideButtons can be found on his [website](https://sensible-side-buttons.archagon.net/). Please consider using his [Amazon affiliate link](http://amzn.to/2tlwbAB) when making any purchase.

SuperSideButtons builds on SaneSideButtons by adding more options for mapping your side buttons to various built-in functions and the ability to map to keyboard macros. If all you're looking for is the ability to bind your side buttons to navigation, check that project out as well!
